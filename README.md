## BlinkAuth: Secure Face Recognition With Real-Time Blink Dynamics Modeling and Anti-Spoofing Intelligence
The BlinkAuth system is a secure biometric authentication solution that combines face recognition with real-time blink dynamics analysis to prevent spoofing attacks and enhance identity verification accuracy.
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
BlinkAuth: Secure Face Recognition With Real-Time Blink Dynamics Modeling and Anti-Spoofing Intelligence is an advanced biometric authentication project designed to address the growing security challenges associated with traditional face recognition systems. Conventional face-based authentication methods are vulnerable to spoofing attacks such as printed photos, video replays, and deepfake media.

This project integrates facial recognition with real-time blink detection and temporal eye movement analysis to verify user liveness. By modeling natural blink patterns and eye dynamics, the system ensures that authentication is performed only for genuine, live users. The solution leverages computer vision, deep learning, and anti-spoofing intelligence to provide a robust, accurate, and user-friendly authentication mechanism suitable for modern security-critical applications.
